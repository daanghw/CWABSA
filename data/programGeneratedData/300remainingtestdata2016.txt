the presentation of $T$ is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there ; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced ihop with a high brow menu .

the $T$ were certainly inventive but $ 8.50 for 3 - 6 '' $T$ ( one of them was more like 5 '' ) in the pancake flight ( sample of 3 different $T$ ) is well over-priced .

the $T$ should be larger ( at least 8 '' ) to justify the expense even with the unique offerings .
