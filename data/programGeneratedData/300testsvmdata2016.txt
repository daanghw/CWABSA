RESTAURANT#GENERAL
 mama mia – i live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great pizza place . the only problem is you really have to warm up the pizza before it 's edible , even when you order ahead . but once done , it 's not too much dough , not too much cheese , not too much sauce .

 mediocre food – we ate on the outside patio area for dinner on a saturday night . the outside patio area has an abbreviated menu . we ordered the marinated grapes , buffalo style chicken wings , and the turkey sandwich . my g/f and i both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the price . we are locals , and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average food is because most customers are probably one-time customer tourists . service was decent . drinks were good . unless you are just stopping in for a few drinks i would n't recommend going here . you are likely to be disappointed .

 excellent food , nice ambience , fairly expensive – i loved the pumpkin ravioli and the goat cheese gnocchi ( 5 big ones to a plate instead of 20 or so little gnocchis ) and my sister loved her filet mignon on top of spinach and mashed potatoes . the ambiance was a peaceful and relaxing break amongst all the kids running around in downtown disney . it was romantic - and even nice even with my sister , reminded me of italy , and had artwork and music that kept up the feeling of being in a mediterrean villa . i recommend it for a night when you want to splurge !

 best indian food in l.a . – i 've been to over a dozen indian places in l.a. , and this is still my favorite . the best thing is , the prices are also quite reasonable . the chicken curry and chicken tikka masala are my favorite meat dishes . the chana masala ( garbanzo beans ) are also excellent . it 's located in a strip mall near the beverly center , not the greatest location , but the food keeps me coming back for more .

nice food but no spice !
FOOD#QUALITY
 nice food but no spice ! – i really enjoyed my meal here . i had yummy lamb korma , saag paneer , samosas , naan , etc . the food was all good but it was way too mild . normally , places ask how hot you want it , but they did n't . i should have thought to bring it up but never expected the food to be that mild . i will give them another chance and make sure to tell them to kick it up several notches . the naan was some of the best i 've had and i really enjoyed the bhartha , not too tomatoey . even the chickpeas , which i normally find too dry , were good . and they packaged everything nicely so it did n't spill .

 holy hummus ! – the food is here is incredible , though the quality is inconsistent during lunch . dinners have always been excellent , in terms of food quality . the open sesame combo plate is a bargain for the heap of food given . the side of potatoes is to die for , as is the labne ( yogurt dip ) . also , they serve the best hummus in america , with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil ( which , i believe is the traditional way ) ! the only drawback is the crowded seating and the slow service . there have been several occasions when we 've just not gotten some side dishes we 've ordered . however , this place is a gem , and i wo n't stop going back .

great beer
DRINKS#QUALITY
 great beer – my first time to dine at this restaurant was with my son and it was absolutely horrible ! we waited over 30 minutes for our drinks and over 1 1/2 hours for our food . i swore never to return for a warm beer and mediocre meal . however , one sunday afternoon my husband and i did go ( although with my loud protests ) and were pleasantly surprised . the band was very good and the service was attentive . outside in the area between the restaurant and the park , children were running around while their parents sipped wine . we ordered a selection of the small plates , and the shoe string onions , goat cheese pizza , grilled asparagus and fried brie with fruit were all very good . it was like dining at a completely different restaurant . we have since returned and also had a great experience , sampling more small plates and a variety of the beer ( cold and good ) . we did have the same waiter the second time , so maybe the service is spotty and our luck is good . sunday afternoons there is a band playing and it is lots of fun .

 enjoyed the food – first of all , i am not from long beach . i was visiting socal a couple of months ago when the friend i was visiting decided to take me to this restaurant . ( she was actually going to take me to another mediterranean restaurant right across the street but they were not open yet even though it was a few minutes past their opening time . ) i liked it . food was good and cheap . i had the kafta plate and i enjoyed it . it was so much though that i could barely finish but i did , since it was delicious . atmosphere was nice . service was kind of slow , our waitress took forever to give us our check even though it was n't that busy . still i would recommend this place . btw , i really like long beach . it was one of the few places in socal where you would actually walk around and not have to take a car .

 should have gone to trader joe 's and had frozen pizza : ( – my family went on a midweek evening to have dinner . the restaurant was 80 % full and there was a sign posted `` wait to be seated . '' well i guess it 's hard to be seated when one is invisible to the staff . we stood there for 10 minutes while employees walked back and forth ignoring us . finally , my wife stood face to face in front of one of the staff and she asked , `` are you waiting for a table ? '' once seated it took about 30 minutes to finally get the meal . the prior reviews said kid friendly ... give me a break with two young children that is light years . the caesar salad i ordered had so much lemon i could n't eat it . the pizza was slightly reminescent of baker 's beach pizza which occupied the the space years ago ( a distant second ) . it was decent but nothing exceptional . this establishment is consistent with my feelings of the rest of chow foods group . we used to frequent most of their restaurants but over the years each one has really been disapointing . i 'm a born and bred southend resident and was excited to hear of this restaurant opening . well , i guess maybe it might be beneficial for the management to pay a visit to tutta bella in columbia city for some tips .

 avoid the place – save yourself the waste of time & do not visit . i made my 1st trip to the restaurant after finding their webpage online . when i got there i sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy & the service was horrible ! i waited for 10-15 minutes for service ordered a beer & was never served again . after sitting there with my empty glass for over 20 minutes i left . i went home & looked them up online again where i discovered there is a link for a give away that does n't work so emailed the restaurant about the non existent service & deceptive link . i never heard back from anyone more than a month ago . after telling my friend about the situation he said lets try again but we will visit the lower bar . after sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the bar keep had made only 2 drinks & kept telling us she 'd be right with us . we left without ever getting service . as of writing this i just tried their give away a link again & it still does n't work . there are so many better places to visit !

 great pizza , poor service – love their pizza , especially the mushroom pizza . also love their caeser salad . prefer to order it and pick it up though because i do n't like the servers , one young woman in particular . she does n't make you feel welcome and treats you like an annoyance . but she is very friendly with certain people , making it even more annoying . management should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners . many people talk about the great pizza and poor service , so it ca n't just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers . it 's a great little place with tons of potential to be a neighborhood joint if the service were n't so impersonal and corporate-like .

 best chinese food i have tasted in a long time – we got a groupon for pagoda and decided to try it on a thursday night . there was a guy playing the piano and singing at the bar area which was separate from the dinning area . you can easily hear him though so it was a pleasant sound and not overbearing . the ambiance of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning . not too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up . the staff was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese . we ordered the honey walnut prawns which we always order at every chinese restaurant to determine the quality of food . first off , the food came fast and all together : ) i like that ... i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other . so about the prawns , they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter ... soooo good ... the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty . yummy . best honey walnyt prawns that we have every tasted . next one that we ordered were prawns and scallop with brocolli . the brocollis were so fresh and tasty . i would normally not finish the brocolli when i order these kinds of food but for the first time , every piece was as eventful as the first one ... the scallops and prawns was so fresh and nicely cooked . not chewy at all . for desert we had the mango ginger creme brulee ... oh la la yummy ! ! ! melt in your mouth . we are for sure coming back to this restaurant . every month if possible . it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel ... but they are definitely one you dont want to miss , esp if your in downtown san jose .

 best chinese food i have tasted in a long time – we got a groupon for pagoda and decided to try it on a thursday night . there was a guy playing the piano and singing at the bar area which was separate from the dinning area . you can easily hear him though so it was a pleasant sound and not overbearing . the ambiance of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning . not too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up . the staff was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese . we ordered the honey walnut prawns which we always order at every chinese restaurant to determine the quality of food . first off , the food came fast and all together : ) i like that ... i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other . so about the prawns , they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter ... soooo good ... the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty . yummy . best honey walnyt prawns that we have every tasted . next one that we ordered were prawns and scallop with brocolli . the brocollis were so fresh and tasty . i would normally not finish the brocolli when i order these kinds of food but for the first time , every piece was as eventful as the first one ... the scallops and prawns was so fresh and nicely cooked . not chewy at all . for desert we had the mango ginger creme brulee ... oh la la yummy ! ! ! melt in your mouth . we are for sure coming back to this restaurant . every month if possible . it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel ... but they are definitely one you dont want to miss , esp if your in downtown san jose .

chintzy portions
FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS
 chintzy portions – the sushi here is perfectly good , but for $ 5 a piece , either the slices of fish should be larger , or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant ( even for nyc ) . we easily spent more than $ 40 per person ( not including alcohol ) and were still hungry . i 'm astonished that this restaurant is categorized as $ $ $ rather than $ $ $ $ .

terrible service , food ok , pricey
SERVICE#GENERAL
 terrible service , food ok , pricey – this past weekend had great weather for san francisco standards . so for the 'after beach excursion ' , we thought we would end the day on a high note and make the trip across the street from the beach to park chalet . the restaurant was busy , however there were a few tables open . we put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it 'd be a 30 minute wait . so here we are , my wife , 3 year old daughter and i trying to pass the time by hanging out in the front of the building ( where the murals and artifacts are ) . 30 minutes went by and sure enough the pager buzzer went off . we went back to the restaurant and low and behold , we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago ! ! logic behind that ? none that i can think of . we put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers , the food did n't arrive until 45 minutes later ... with our main course . um so now what are appetizers for ? ? ? oh i forgot to mention that they do n't have bread service . its a good thing my daughter had some snacks in her lunch bag . my wife also ordered a teapot of hot water ( she had a sore throat ) and i guess that since it was only water , it was n't a priority for them to actually bring it . in other words , if they are n't making $ $ off of you then you do n't rate high on their 'service scale ' . food wise , its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant is n't a fancy place . the upside of the restaurant ? if i needed to name some they would include the location to the beach or golden gate park . its great if you spent the day there and did n't want to drive to eat . parking is reasonably good , they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby . another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides . i 'd hate for tourists to go to park chalet and think that this is how all san francisco restaurants are like .

very poor customer service .
SERVICE#GENERAL
 very poor customer service . – schooner or later 's charming location along the marina in long beach and average food does not , unfortunately , compensate for its very poor customer service . while this diner had reasonably good food , the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence , and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service . as part of a small party of four , our food was dropped off without comment ; any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table . when we finally were able to flag someone down , it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food , who was also not the same person who had taken our order . after one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress , a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant . a brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment - to say we had been `` blown off '' would be an understatement . the manager continually interrupted with `` is there anything else i can do for you ? `` , a strange comment because she had hardly listened , let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience . she promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage , but we could hardly take her promise seriously , seeing as she had n't bothered to get the waitresses name . in short , schooner or later could n't have cared less about our being at their establishment . next time we will go somewhere else , or try other restaurants close by like mimi 's cafe and claim jumper .

FOOD#QUALITY
 good food , great service , average prices ( for the strip ) – i decided to eat at stack because of their price fixed pre-show dinner . when i walked in , i was taken aback by their incredible wood decor . the music playing was very hip , 20-30 something pop music , but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat , which became annoying midway through dinner . we were quickly seated and requested the special dinner , which came with : 1 ) shellfish and shrimp appetizer or caesar salad , 2 ) 9 oz steak ( with a single potato chip ) , and 3 ) homemade donut holes . i got the shellfish and shrimp appetizer and it was alright . it was n't the freshest seafood ever , but the taste and presentation was ok . before the steak came , the server told us that the steak did not come with any sides and suggested i pick something from the menu . i picked the asparagus , which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared . it was steamed and tossed with garlic . the 9 oz steak came next and it tasted great , at least initially . the steak was done to my exact liking ( medium rare ) and was nice and juicy . it ? s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction , though both were indistinguishable in taste . though , one thing i realized later on was that the restaurant either used msg or a meat tenderizer on the steak . my mouth felt very dry afterwards and i had that signature ? msg ? taste lingering in my throat after i left the restaurant . finally , the homemade donut holes were served for desert . they came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting ; very light and not-too-sweet . the desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner . the dinner only took us about an hour and the prices were alright for the strip , almost $ 50 / pp after tax and tip ( about average ) . but the servers were extremely attentive and very friendly . overall , i would go back and eat at the restaurant again . just remember to dress a little urban-chic so you don ? t look too far out of place .

FOOD#QUALITY
 overpriced – we dined at the colorado location today . waited 35 minutes for a table for 8 which was ok for such a big crowd . the waiter was a bit unfriendly and the feel of the restaurant was crowded . also , there was only one bathroom stall- probably need more for such big crowds . most importantly , we were so excited about the food after seeing the very creative menu . at best , the food was good and definately overpriced . for the amount of food we got the prices should have been lower . not sure if i would go back .

my favortie pizza joint in seattle
RESTAURANT#GENERAL
 my favortie pizza joint in seattle – this is my `` must bring out of town guests to '' restaurant and they always enjoy and rave about it . in fact , many want to return a second time during their visit . the pizza is delicious and the salads are fantastic . i 've always found the wait staff and , if you sit at the bar , the cooks very friendly . they are n't the most talkative , but everytime i 've been there they have been very busy , which probably accounts for the lack of conversation . i also really enjoy the simplicity of the decor and intimate feeling of a small restaurant . it 's just the right size for the menu .

big thick pepperoni
FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS
 big thick pepperoni – the pepperoni 's cut real thick - yum . the pizza itself is not exactly the best i 've had ever , but still pretty good . i probably would n't go back though 'cuz i do n't know if it 's worth it . maybe i 'll go back once more many years from now when i 've forgotten i went there already .

sit in the balcony
AMBIENCE#GENERAL
 sit in the balcony – not bad . food was good and appetizing . portions was just enough for me , but may not be for a big eater . fair menu selection . the appetizer was interesting , but the creme brulee was very savory and delicious . indoor ambience was modern . if it 's nice outside , request for a table in the balcony . it 's a great place to people watch . although the service could be improved considering the money you put in . our drinks kept coming but our server came by a couple times . should check-up on us more frequently , do n't you think ?

 late night dinning with exeptional food . – i did n't want to go there because of the reviews and prices i saw on the internet . that was the last night in vegas and was too late and most of the restaurant were closing - so we walked in the check the place . we were seated right away , the table was private and nice . the service was exceptional - sometime there was a feeling that we were served by the army of friendly waiters . the food was very good , filet mignon was probably the best i 've ever try . the portions are big though , so do not order too much . groovy music made the dinner casual . the most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places . i have a but here - there was a bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd . the bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink , the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser . there were 3 bottles of perfume on the sink and the line of girls trying to use the sink . i felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom .

- mediocre service / quality
SERVICE#GENERAL
 insultingly overpriced - mediocre service / quality – this review is for the southglen location which is not listed in citysearch : i wish this review would make a difference enough for it to be addressed by management but snooze has people climbing over each other for a chance to eat at this overpriced restaurant with mediocre food and service , so this review as well as the other negative ones for their larimer location will go unaddressed . the presentation of snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there ; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced ihop with a high brow menu . to start off , approximately 8-10 oz of orange juice will cost you $ 3 . they serve it in a tall , skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket . i should have just asked for the check when i saw that ; but their menu was so unique that i continued . the pancakes were certainly inventive but $ 8.50 for 3 - 6 '' pancakes ( one of them was more like 5 '' ) in the pancake flight ( sample of 3 different pancakes ) is well over-priced . the pancakes should be larger ( at least 8 '' ) to justify the expense even with the unique offerings . the flavors were good but i have had far better pancakes at a german pancake specialty restaurant that were a little cheaper but significantly larger . on my meal i had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking , and would have had to send them back again if i had n't rejected the meal all together . i rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and i was too frustrated to continue . to their credit they removed the dish from the check ; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was . in the end our check came to $ 27 for 4 small pancakes , a breakfast burrito , an orange juice and an iced tea ( i had water ) . this was 2 times what the same meal would have cost at le peep . snooze provided an inventive pancake offering , but le peep would have provided better service and quality .

 insultingly overpriced - mediocre service / quality – this review is for the southglen location which is not listed in citysearch : i wish this review would make a difference enough for it to be addressed by management but snooze has people climbing over each other for a chance to eat at this overpriced restaurant with mediocre food and service , so this review as well as the other negative ones for their larimer location will go unaddressed . the presentation of snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there ; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced ihop with a high brow menu . to start off , approximately 8-10 oz of orange juice will cost you $ 3 . they serve it in a tall , skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket . i should have just asked for the check when i saw that ; but their menu was so unique that i continued . the pancakes were certainly inventive but $ 8.50 for 3 - 6 '' pancakes ( one of them was more like 5 '' ) in the pancake flight ( sample of 3 different pancakes ) is well over-priced . the pancakes should be larger ( at least 8 '' ) to justify the expense even with the unique offerings . the flavors were good but i have had far better pancakes at a german pancake specialty restaurant that were a little cheaper but significantly larger . on my meal i had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking , and would have had to send them back again if i had n't rejected the meal all together . i rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and i was too frustrated to continue . to their credit they removed the dish from the check ; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was . in the end our check came to $ 27 for 4 small pancakes , a breakfast burrito , an orange juice and an iced tea ( i had water ) . this was 2 times what the same meal would have cost at le peep . snooze provided an inventive pancake offering , but le peep would have provided better service and quality .
