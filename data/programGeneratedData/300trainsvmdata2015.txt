 judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer . we , there were four of us , arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude . they never brought us complimentary noodles , ignored repeated requests for sugar , and threw our dishes on the table . the food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny . after all that , they complained to me about the small tip . avoid this place !

 i was very disappointed with this restaurant . ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away . i had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish ive requested . food was okay , nothing great . chow fun was dry ; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family . i/we will never go back to this place again .

 i had my eyes on this place , promising myself i will one day 'give it a try . ' and i hate to say this but i doubt i 'll ever go back . the food is very average ... the thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet , every thing they serve is too sweet here . the only thing i moderately enjoyed was their grilled chicken special with edamame puree . i had never had edamame pureed before but i thought it was innovative and tasty ( could 've used a bit more salt ) . anyways , if you 're in the neighborhood to eat good food , i would n't waste my time trying to find something , rather go across the street to tamari . the decor is night tho ... but they really need to clean that vent in the ceiling ... its quite un-appetizing , and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern .

 we ate outside at haru 's sake bar because haru 's restaurant next door was overflowing . what 's the difference between the two ? their sake list was extensive , but we were looking for purple haze , which was n't listed but made for us upon request ! the spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome , great appetizer to share ! we went around 9:30 on a friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great !

 i have eaten here a handful of times , for no reason besides sheer convenience . ( i hang out , and live , in the neighborhood.. ) the food is decent . however , it 's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth . i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect , which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me , i.e . make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water , or the check . i know , you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored , but my agenda is i 'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends , seeking a pleasant experience . well , i did n't find it there , and trust , i have told everyone i can think of about my experience . the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty . hmmm .

 the food here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it . i like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing . the service varys from day to day- sometimes they 're very nice , and sometimes not . the kitchen however , is almost always slow . also , specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you do n't . the ambience is pretty and nice for conversation , so a casual lunch here would probably be best .

 i stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two fridays ago when i was with two friends in town from l.a . being serious sushi lovers , we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action . i asked the chef what he recommends and he asked me if i like uni . ( for those of you who do n't know , uni is sea urchin in japanese , which happens to be my favorite . ) he served me an uni hand roll , which i never had before , and let me tell you ... it was heaven ! aside from the sea urchin , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including fatty yellow tail , boton shrimp , blue fin torro ( fatty tuna ) , sea eel , etc . the sake menu should not be overlooked ! all in all , this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city . try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll .

 we visited orsay during ny restaurant week and tried their $ 35 menu . service was very good - prompt , attentive and non-intrusive . food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience ) . wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top . traditional french decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .

RESTAURANT#GENERAL
 i 've been to at cafe spice probably 5-8 times , it is probably still the best indian restaurant around union square . to sum it up : service varies from good to mediorce , depending on which waiter you get ; generally it is just average ok . seating is always prompt , though the restaurant does fill up in the evening . food is usually very good , though ocasionally i wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders . as many other reviewers noticed , your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time . the decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date .

the bagel was huge .
FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS
 our first time in new york and we had to try a new york bagel . we were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem . the bagel was huge . they were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior . the workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese ( gets a little messy ) . i loved it and would highly recommend .

( that is a must , but not every restaurant can do ... ) if you want to dine with large party , i recommend to make reservation basement . there 's nice and quiet , small but enough for 6 ( or more ) .

FOOD#QUALITY
 this is some really good , inexpensive sushi . it costs $ 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll , but the roll more than triples in size , and that 's not just from the rice . the spicy tuna roll is huge and probably the best that i 've had at this price range . the yellowtail was particularly good as well . i have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu . in any event , this is a place i 'll be sure to stop by again when i 'm in this part of town .

 right off the l in brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza . mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta ( raddichio was kind of bitter though ) . my friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better . the sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day . kind of a small place but i guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids . overall i would recommend it and go back again . coming from boston this place is like emma 's pizza in kendall square in cambridge ( although they have more funky toppings ! )

 first of all , this place is *not* romantic , as claimed by citysearch 's editorial review . either that , or the editor 's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th . the tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced . slightly above average wines start at $ 70+ with only one selection listed at $ 30+ . service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category . for instance , plates were just dumped on the table , i was handed the wine list upside down , etc ... . somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service . to be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora .

 first of all , this place is *not* romantic , as claimed by citysearch 's editorial review . either that , or the editor 's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th . the tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced . slightly above average wines start at $ 70+ with only one selection listed at $ 30+ . service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category . for instance , plates were just dumped on the table , i was handed the wine list upside down , etc ... . somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service . to be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora .

FOOD#QUALITY
 with the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering , the food here was decent , not great . the menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees . we ordered the special , grilled branzino , that was so infused with bone , it was difficult to eat . the decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the east village - not romantic , just simple , small and sparse . problem is nothing at prune is particularly memorable . no plans to return anytime soon .

 honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives . believe us , we 've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs . not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly . the all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality . limited menu , no-so-fresh ingredients , thinly-sliced fish , fall-apart rice . the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce ( even its low sodium ) , the vinegar-soaked rice , and the scallion on top of the fish . the waitstaffs are nice though . wont come back again for sure !

 mermaid inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood . the menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent . the lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with scallops and shrimp is great . the service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing . the only fallback on this restaurant is the prices . even though its good seafood , the prices are too high . the lobster sandwich is $ 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price .

 went to village last night for my birthday . we picked it randomly , without a recommendation from someone who has been there , so we were n't sure what to expect . we were very pleasantly surprised . the food was delicious ( i had a halibut special , my husband had steak ) , and the service was top-notch . when my dessert came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort . truly the mark of an attentive waiter . i highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night .

i like cafe noir dont get me wrong , it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent ! !
SERVICE#GENERAL
 i like cafe noir dont get me wrong , it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent ! ! the service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served . the waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing . after dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend , asked him : where are you from ... maybe you dont know how things work in america ... and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on . we did tip , i guess the model / waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager . the whole set up is truly unprofessional and i wish cafe noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place .

 what a great place . i came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband . the ambience was so fun , and the prices were great , on top of the fact that the food was really tasty . i was n't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes , but i guess that 's the price you pay for a popular place . i would definitely recommend sea if you like thai cuisine !

SERVICE#GENERAL
 i was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever . a gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order . when asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants , he replied this is not mcdonald 's , every place makes things differently while it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude . the service was poor , restaurant poorly lit , staff not very attentive and i would have rather eaten at a mcdonald 's than this joint . never again !

 i got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries . i would recommend roxy 's for that , but not for their food . my son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge ! but , they were too big for the bun . consequently , their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them . also they were $ 15 each ! i had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll . it was $ 14 not really bad for a pound of pastrami-but it did n't have much taste-i 've had better for less elsewhere !

 this place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant , the food . the last two times i ordered from here my food was soo spicy that i could barely eat it , and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish . and the tom kha soup was pathetic . if you want good authentic thai this place is not the place to go .

 we had the lobster sandwich and it was fantastic . my husband said he could 've eaten several more , the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had . we had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful . i recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one . we waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right . we will be back .

 went to cafe spice with 4 of my friends on a saturday night . we were greeted promptly by the waiter who was very nice and cordial . she was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about indian food . we were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry . the food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates . we ended our great experience by having gulab jamun ( dessert ) recommended by the waiter . i thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others .

the food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back .
FOOD#QUALITY
 the food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back . immediately after we paid , the waiter took the money and said , okay , you guys are outta here . there are other people waiting ! we were n't even at our table for more than an hour total . as we were leaving , the couple standing by the door said to another waiter , we 're not in a hurry . our friends have not arrived yet . so rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary ! for the people who want great food plus great service , roxy is a place to avoid !

 as a retired hipster , i can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year lucky strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city . the wait staff is pleasant , fun , and for the most part gorgeous ( in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way , not in that she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b @ # $ * way ) . the food is yummy , especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries . but the best part about ls is the late night atmosphere , delightfully free of the bts . you can get a completely delish martini in a glass ( that 's about 2 1/2 drinks ) for $ 8.50 ( i recommend the vanilla shanty , mmmm ! ) in a great homey setting with great music . the in-house lady dj on saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music , and moreover , takes requests . you ca n't go wrong with this place .

suan is a great place that i often take my friends ( classmates ) too .
RESTAURANT#GENERAL
 suan is a great place that i often take my friends ( classmates ) too . its location is good and the fact that hutner college is near and their prices are very reasonable , makes students go back to suan again and again . i love their thai noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the must ! i was in love with pongsri on 48th , but compared to suan it is slow in service and overpriced . i will go back to suan soon ! in summer-eat outside on a terrace ( another great feature of suan ) ! ! !

 my friend from milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian . too bad the food was n't of the same heritage . the porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless , so was the seafood tagliatelle . a real dissapointment . but that was n't the icing on the cake : a tiramisu that resembled nothing i have ever had . they should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies . priced at upper intermediate range .

 went to ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza ( as i love la pizza fresca ) . was surprisingly disappointed . pizza was a little soggy . ravioli was good ... but i have to say that i found everything a bit overpriced . not enough wines by the glass either . service , however , was excellent ... and i liked the setting/atmosphere a lot . food was just average ... if they lowered the prices just a bit , it would be a bigger draw .

SERVICE#GENERAL
 we were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date . we were then shooed inside . one would think we 'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead , we got a snobby waiter would n't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so . we left , never to return . with so many good restaurants on the uws , i do n't need overpriced food , absurdly arrogant wait-staff who do n't recognize they work at a glorified diner , clumsy service , and management that does n't care .

 i just read mocaramel 's review and felt compelled to respond . i have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at la lanterna . over the years the host , vittorio , and his crew , have always treated me as family - although with all the business this not-so-little gem does , it amazing he 's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor . i 've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years : a new jazz bar , the most fantastic dining garden , the best thin crust pizzas , and now a lasagna menu which is to die for ( these are not your average lasagnas ) ! i love this place ! keep up the good work guys !
